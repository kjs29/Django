What is a Django?

Django is a python web based framework.

# Things I learned.

- Every time I make an app, I need to go to settings.py, I need to register an app in the `INSTALLED_APPS`
- `views.py` in the app folder handles REQUESTS. Request -> Response
```
# What views.py can do
# Pull data from database
# Transform data
# Send email
```
