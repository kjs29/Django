# is it better to save image files as binary files or original image file in django?

ChatGPT says

In Django, it is typically better to save image files as binary files in the database rather than as the original image file.

Storing images in binary format in the database can simplify your file structure and make it easier to manage the files within your application.

For example, you can easily retrieve the binary data and convert it back to an image file whenever you need to display the image to the user. 

This also makes it easier to perform database migrations, since you don't need to worry about copying image files from one location to another.

However, it's important to keep in mind that storing large amounts of binary data in the database can have performance implications, especially if you have a large number of images. 

In these cases, it's often a better choice to store the images on the file system and save a reference to the image in the database, rather than storing the binary data directly. 

This can help to keep your database size manageable and improve performance.

Ultimately, the choice of whether to store images as binary files or as original image files depends on the specific needs of your application and the amount of data you need to store. 

It's a good idea to carefully consider the trade-offs and choose the solution that works best for you.
