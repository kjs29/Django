# What is a project vs what is an app?

## Project is like a collection of apps.

### For example, an instagram is a project.

### Direct message, marketplace, feed, explore page are apps.

# Command Prompt Lines

## Start a project

```console
(virtual_env) C:\Desktop\website > django-admin startproject myproject
```
This will create files like this
```
website\
    myproject\
        myproject\
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        manage.py
```


## Start an app

If <em>manage.py</em> is located in C:\Users\Daily\Desktop\website\myproject,

Make sure that the current directory is the same directory as manage.py's directory

in this case, it is <em>C:\Users\Daily\Desktop\website\myproject</em>

```console
(virtual_env) C:\Users\Daily\Desktop\website\myproject > py manage.py startapp name_of_app
```
This will create files like this
```
website\
    myproject\
        myapp\
            migrations\
                __init__.py
            __init.py
            admin.py
            apps.py
            models.py
            tests.py
            views.py
        myproject\
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        manage.py
```
