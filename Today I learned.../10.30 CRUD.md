We have database

Lawyer

|name|nickname|id|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|John|Jonny|1|
|Craig|Cry|2|
|Gill|Topg|3|

Client

|name|lawyer|id|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Aba|John|1|
|Jay|John|2|
|Agron|Craig|3|
|Raymond|Gill|4|
|Ying|Gill|5|
|Herold|Gill|6|

<a name = "create"></a>

# ${To\ {\color{blueviolet}Create}}\ data $


### 1. Go to python shell
```
py manage.py shell
```
### 2. Import Object from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

Ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3. Create data (In this case, let's create a new client)
```
>>> next_instance = Client(name="Jessica", lawyer="Gill")
```
if we type 

```
>>> next_instance
```

we get
```
<Client: Jessica>
```

### 4. Save
```
next_instance.save()
```

<a name = "read"></a>

# ${To\ {\color{yellow}Read}}\ data$

Now we can check our database for Client

### 1. Go to python shell

```py
py manage.py shell
```

### 2. Import Object from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

Ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3.1 Read all instances

```
>>> all = Client.objects.all()
```
Now we can see every instance by typing 
```
>>> all
```
We can see every instance like this.
```
<QuerySet [<Client: Aba (1)>, <Client: Jay (2)>, <Client: Agron (3)>, <Client: Raymond (4)>, <Client: Ying (5)>, <Client: Herold (6)>, <Client: Jessica (7)>]>
```
We can see that `<Client: Jessica (7)>` is also in the Client query set, because we just created the [new instance](#create).

### 3.2 Read the first instance

There are two ways to read the first instance in the database.

The first way
```
>>> first_client = Client.objects.first()
```
```
>>> first_client
```
The second way
```py
>>> first_client = Client.objects.all()[0]
```
```
>>> first_client
```
Both the first way and the second way will show like this

```
<Client: Aba (1)>
```

# ${To\ {\color{orange}Update}}\ data$


# ${To\ {\color{grey}Delete}}\ data$
