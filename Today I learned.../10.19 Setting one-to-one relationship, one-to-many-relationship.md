# One-to-one relationship, one-to-many relationships

Let's say that there are entities called 'customer' and 'address'.

In our website, we can let one customer have only one address. And that address should have only that specific customer.

In this case it is one-to-one relationship and this is how we set it in our <em><strong>app / models.py</strong></em>


### Setting One-to-one relationships

<em>app / models.py</em>
```py
from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)    
class Address(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
    customer = models.OnetoOneField(Customer, on_delete = models.CASCADE, primary_key = True)
```

In the last line of the code snippet above, the argument says `on_delete = CASCADE` which means that

it deletes the associates fields once the parent object is deleted.

ex) if customer A is deleted, address associated with customer A is also deleted.

---
But then let's say that we allow one customer to have many addresses.

### Setting One-to-many relationships

<em>app / models.py</em>
```py
fomr django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
class Address(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_legnth = 255)
    customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer, on_delete = models.CASCADE)
```
