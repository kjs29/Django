# How to get the data we want in one-to-many relationships


Let's say that we have two different models `Library` and `Books`.

One library has many books so it is a `one-to-many relationships` for library to books or `many-to-one relationships` for books to libraries.

<em><strong>app1 / models.py</strong></em>

```py
from django.db import models

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 50)
    
    # put 's' to imply that it is one-to-many relationships
    books = models.ForeignKey(Books, on_delete = models.SET_NULL)

```
# What if we want to find books from library called 'Millenium"?

1. Open the python shell and import the appropriate models

```
py manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from app1.models import Books, Library
```

2. Set a variable called `millenium` that gets library called `Millenium`
```
>>> millenium = Library.objects.get(name="Millenium")
```
3. Find books from that library using `.filter()`method.
```
>>> Books.objects.filter(library=millenium)
```

Result
```
<QuerySet [<Books: Seven habits of highly effective people>, <Books: Harry Potter>, <Books: Security Analysis>...]>
```

# What if we want to get all the books that are from the `Millenium` library?

## This is called `reverse relationship query` in django.

And we can simply find the books that are from the millenium library by doing this.

Let's say we already imported the `Library` and `Books` models.

1. Set the variable which represents what we are trying to search, in this case we want to find books that are from millenium library so it is library.

```
>>> millenium = Library.objects.get(name="Millenium")
```

2. Find the related queries.

```
>>> millenium.Books_set.all()
```

Result
```
<QuerySet [<Books: Seven habits of highly effective people>, <Books: Harry Potter>, <Books: Security Analysis>...]>
```

# The difference between the first, and the second query ways.

# Books have ForeignKey, but Library doesn't have ForeignKey.

## `Relationship : One Library has many books.`

That means, books have ForeignKey to library.

<strong>Books</strong>
|Name|ForeignKey<br>(This represents what library the book is located in)|
|---|---|
|Seven habits of highly effective people|1|
|Harry Potter|2|
|Great Gatsby|1|
|Security Analysis|1|

So it is natural for us to find books that have specific foreignkey (Because each foreignkey means that each library)

First example : Get books that have library called 'millenium'
```
>>> millenium = Library.objects.get(name="millenium")

>>> Books.objects.filter(library = millenium)
```


Second example : Get books that are related to millenium library

```
>>> millenium = Library.objects.get(name="millenium")

>>> millenium.Books_set.all()
```

The result shows the same, but the second one is useful when there is no foreignkey assigned.

Notice that each books have assigned foreignkey which represents each individual library.

But when we want to find library that have no foreignkey assigned to books, then we can use reverse relationship query way.

```
>>> harrypotter = Books.objects.get(name="Harry Potter")

>>> harrypotter.Library_set.all()
```
