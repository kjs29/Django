# 10/12 Today I learned...


# Method 1 (put the templates folder inside the app)
## 1. `templates` folder is created in the app folder `myfirstapp`
## 2. inside the `templates` folder, create another folder called `myfirstapp`, that is the same name as app
## 3. create a html file in `myfirstapp\templates\myfirstapp`, ex) home.html

<em>home.html</em>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Django Fortune Teller</title>
    <style>
      body {
        text-align: center;
        background-color: black;
        color: green;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Here is your fortune:</h1>

    <h4>{{ fortune }}</h4>
  </body>
</html>
```
## 4. in the myfirstapp\views.py

In the `render()` function, there are three arguments that go in

request, template_name, mapping

In the template_name, that is where the directory of the `home.html` can go in.


### directory of the template = `myfirstapp\templates\myfirstapp\home.html`

### as the second argument in render function = `myfirstapp/home.html`

<em>views.py</em>
```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from random

fortuneList = [
    "You will achieve what you want to achieve",
    "You have the power to change your future."
]

def index(request):
    pickone = random.choice(fortuneList)
    context = {"fortune" : pickone}
    
    # render function arguments as return value
    # this is where template directory can go in
    return render(request, "myfirstapp/home.html", context)
```
## 5. in the myfirstapp\urls.py
<em>urls.py</em>

```py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index)
]
```
