# How to load src files in Django

Let's say there is html file

```html
<div class="hero">
    <img src="images/lawyer.png" alt=""/>
</div>
```

We just need to change to this.

```html
<div class="hero">
    <img src="{% static 'images/lawyer.png' %}" alt=""/>
</div>
```

Basically we need to add

```
{% static 'path/to/file.ext' %}
```
