# Models

When we create a project, `models.py` is created.

Inside of `models.py`, it looks like this.

```py
from django.db import models

```

We inherit `django.db.models.Model` to class that we create,

This lets us know that we will be creating this `Patient` schema in our database later on.
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    pass
```

# Metadata in models

In `models.py` we also use `Meta` class, 

Anything but fields can go in here.

One good example would be `ordering`

<em><strong>models.py</strong></em>
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ["name"]
```

# Overriding `__str__`

When we retrieve information from our models that we created,

sometimes we will see 

```
<QuerySet [<Patient:>,<Patient:>,<Patient:>....]
```

But if we put `__str__` in `models.py`,

<em><strong>models.py</strong></em>
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    
    ---snip---
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Then the results will look like this.

```
<QuerySet [<Patient:Jack>,<Patient:Roxi>,<Patient:Christiane>....]
```
