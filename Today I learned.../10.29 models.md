# Models

When we create a project, `models.py` is created.

Inside of `models.py`, it looks like this.

```py
from django.db import models

```

We inherit `django.db.models.Model` to class that we create,

This lets us know that we will be creating this `Patient` schema in our database later on.
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    pass
```
