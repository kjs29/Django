# Models

When we create a project, `models.py` is created.

Inside of `models.py`, it looks like this.

```py
from django.db import models

```

We inherit `django.db.models.Model` to class that we create,

This lets us know that we will be creating this `Patient` schema in our database later on.
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    pass
```


In `models.py` we also use `Meta` class, 

Anything but fields can go in here.

One good example would be `ordering`

<em><strong>models.py</strong></em>
```py
from django.db import models

class Patient(models.Model):
    name = CharField(max_length = 100)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ["name"]
``
