# 10/10 Today I learned... 

On website, there is WEB CLIENT and WEB SERVER.

WEB CLIENT is like people who visit.

WEB SERVER is like the host of the website.

When a visitor enters URL `myawesome_website.com` in their browser,

<em>URL = Uniform Resource Locator </em>

The WEB CLIENT sends a REQUEST to THE WEB SERVER.

And the WEB SERVER returns the RESPONSE back to the WEB CLIENT.

This data exchange (REQUEST and RESPONSE) is defined called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

##
```
HTTP defines how THE CLIENT and THE SERVER can communicate.
