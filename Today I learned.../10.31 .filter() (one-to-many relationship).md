# How to get the data we want in one-to-many relationships


Let's say that we have two different models `Library` and `Books`.

One library has many books so it is a `one-to-many relationships` for library to books or `many-to-one relationships` for books to libraries.

<em><strong>app1 / models.py</strong></em>

```py
from django.db import models

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 50)
    
    # put 's' to imply that it is one-to-many relationships
    books = models.ForeignKey(Books, on_delete = models.SET_NULL)

```
# What if we want to find books from library called 'Millenium"?

1. Open the python shell and import the appropriate models

```
py manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from app1.models import Books, Library
```

2. Set a variable called `millenium` that gets library called `Millenium`
```
>>> millenium = Library.objects.get(name="Millenium")
```
3. Find books from that library using `.filter()`method.
```
>>> Books.objects.filter(library=millenium)
```

Result
```
<QuerySet [<Books: Seven habits of highly effective people>, <Books: Harry Potter>, <Books: Security Analysis>...]>
```
