# 10/23 Today I learned...

# CSS files take a long time to load...

I searched this issue on the internet,

And they said I can do one of the two solutions to fix this issue.

1. ```CTRL + F5 (Do a full page refresh on a browser)```

2.

```
Disable caching in the developer tool of your browser. 
If using chrome click the 3 dots on the top right side of your browser then
click on more tools   
then click on Developer tools 
then go to the Network tab 
There you will see a "Disable Cache" checkbox on the left.
```
