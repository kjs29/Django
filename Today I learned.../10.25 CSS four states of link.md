# There are four states of the link

- not clicked (when it is not clicked)
-  hover (when it is hovered)
-  active (when it is clicked at that time)
-  visited (when it has been visited already)



```css
/*This styles a link when it is not clicked*/
a:link {

}

/*This styles a link that has been visited*/
a:visited {

}

/*This styles a link when hovered*/
a:hovered {

}

/*This styles a link when a link is clicked*/
a:active {

}
```
