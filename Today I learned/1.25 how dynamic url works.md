# How dynamic url works with parameters

In our urls.py in the app folder we usually have,

```py
#...

urlpatterns = [
    path('<str:username>/<str:id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
]
```

These are dynamic urls, meaning that depending on our username urlconf will find the matching string(`<str:username>/`, `<str:id>/`) and connect to the function in views.py.

I was always wondering how this dynamic URL works.

Question I asked on ChatGPT is

`In django, how does it automatically know that I want to go to www.example.com/profile/Sarah when I just click Sarah's profile in the home page? `

The ChatGPT's answer is this.

```
In Django, URLs are mapped to views using URL patterns. 

When a user clicks a link, the URL is sent to the server and the server uses the URL patterns to determine which view should handle the request. 

The view then renders the appropriate template, which may include links to other URLs. 

For example, if you have a link on your home page that goes to "www.example.com/profile/Sarah", 

the server would look for a URL pattern that matches that URL and then call the view function that is associated with that pattern. 

In the view function, you can retrieve the user's profile information and pass it to the template which renders the profile page, 

so when user click on the link of Sarah's profile in the home page, 

it will automatically direct user to the profile page of Sarah by calling the appropriate view function.
```

URL automatically figures out what goes in the url. Like, if the url for this specific page is `www.example.com/<str:first>/<str:second>/`, the server tries to figure out what would be in the place of `<str:first>` and `<str:second>`.

# How Dynamic URL works.

1. Go to `urls.py` first.

    In `urls.py`,
    
    ```py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    
    urlpatterns = [
        #...
        path('<str:username>/<str:id>', views.detail, name='detail'),
        #...
    ]
    ```
    
    it finds what function is used. It uses `detail()` function in `views.py`. Go to `views.detail`.

2.  In `views.py`,

    ```py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import Question, Choice, User
    
    def home(request):
        questions = Question.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'home.html', {'questions':questions})

    def detail(request, username, id):
        user = User.objects.get(name=username)  # this username should match the name of parameters in detail function
        question = Question.objects.get(pk=id)  # this id should match the name of parameters in detail function
        return render(request,'detail.html', {'question':question})
    ```

    View is connecting with templates in render function (`home.html`,`detail.html`), and now go to `home.html`, and `detail.html`

3.  Go to templates files,

- In `home.html`,

    ```html
    <!-- ... -->
    {% for each_question in questions %}
        <a href="{% url 'detail' each_question.author each_question.id %}">{{ each_question.question_text }}</a>
    <!-- ... -->
    ```

    # Important points

    - `questions` in `{% for each_question in questions %}` should match the key in the `{'questions':questions}` in views.home function.
    
    - This `each_question.author` and `each_question.id` in the url template tag are optional arguments and they should match the urlpatterns in `urls.py`. 
    
        <em>urls.py</em>

        ```py
        urlpatterns = [
            path('<str:username>/<str:id>/',)
        ]
        ```
        
      So this `each_question.author` should match `<str:username>/` and `each_question.id` should match `<str:id>/`. Order matters. In short, URL in `<a></a>` tag should match `urlpatterns` in urls.py. 



- In `detail.html`,

    ```html
    <!-- ... -->
    {{ question.question_text }}
    <!-- ... -->
    ```

    Just like we saw in `home.html`, the `question` variable in the `{{ question.question_text }}` tag refers to the key in the dictionary that was passed from views.home function.
