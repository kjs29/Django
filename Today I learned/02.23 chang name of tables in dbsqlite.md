# 02/23 Today I learned ...

I changed the field name from `Post.likes` to `Post.liked_users`

In my local django project, 

I usually have to do

```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
```

```
$ python manage.py migrate
```

But on Pythonanywhere.com it wouldn't work on their console.

So I had to manually change the table name

# Before deleting the database on Pythonanywhere.com, it is important to download the file somewhere else. Because it will delete all the data once database file is removed from pythonanywhere.com

We now have to change the name of the table in the downloaded file.

On terminal,

Open the file `db.sqlite3`

```
sqlite> sqlite3 db.sqlite3
```

Show the whole tables in the file

```
sqlite> .tables
```

And we can see

```
auth_group                  blog_post                 
auth_group_permissions      blog_post_likes     
auth_permission             django_admin_log          
auth_user                   django_content_type       
auth_user_groups            django_migrations         
auth_user_user_permissions  django_session            
blog_comment 
```

And there I changed the table `blog_post_likes` to `blog_post_liked_users`

```
ALTER TABLE blog_post_likes RENAME TO blog_post_liked_users;
```

And I uploaded the edited `db.sqlite3` to Pythonanywhere.com
