# To practice models.py

We can practice creating different models in `models.py` and register in `admin.py`

And in admin panel, we can see how these work together.

## Example


<em>models.py</em>

```py
from django.db import models

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    library = models.ForeignKey(Library)
    
```

<em>admin.py</em>

```py
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    library = models.ForeignKey(Library,on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

# Timezone

If we want to change our timezones, 

we go to `settings.py` and go to `TIME_ZONE` and change it to our time. I am in Calgary and if I search for `TZ database name` for Calgary I can find `Canada/Mountain`.

So in `settings.py`

```py
TIME_ZONE = 'Canada/Mountain'
```

But in the interactive shell API, it won't be refelcted but on the database admin panel, it will show the timezone correctly.

```
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> print(timezone.now())
```

This will NOT show the appropriate local time even after changing `TIME_ZONE` in `settings.py`

But in `models.py` if we set the 

`created_date = DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)`

Then we can find the appropriate time showing in the admin panel.

# Query 

Let's say we have `Celebrity` and `Fan` model.

Celebrity can have many fans but fan can have only one celebrity.

Then Fan to Celebrity is one to many relationship.

```py
from django.db import models

class Celebrity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Fan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    celebrity = models.ForeignKey(Celebrity, on_delete = models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

```

In our API interactive shell, we can create celebrity object.

```
python manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from appname.models import Celebrity, Fan
>>> first = Celebrity(name = "Brad Pitt")
>>> first.save()
```

Let's see the fans that like `Brad Pitt`.

```
>>> first.fan_set.all()
<QuerySet []>
```

Now we can also create a couple of fans who like `Brad Pitt`.

```
>>> first.fan_set.create(name="christina")
>>> a = first.fan_set.create(name="So young")
```

```
a.celebrity
<Celebrity: Brad Pitt>
```

This shows we can access to any subfields in any models as long as they are relational.

Relationship between Celebrity and Fan 

`Celebrity : Fan = One : Many` 

### When we want to access all Fan that like `Brad Pitt` 

1. Directly from Fans

```
>>> Fan.objects.filter(celebrity="Brad Pitt")
```

2. Using related object set

```
>>> brad_pitt = Celebrity.objects.get(name="Brad Pitt")
>>> brad_pitt.fan_set.all()
```

### What celebrity does `So young` like?

Since one fan can like just one celebrity we can easily find out by

```
>>> Fan.objects.get(name="So young").celebrity
<Celebrity: Brad Pitt>
```
