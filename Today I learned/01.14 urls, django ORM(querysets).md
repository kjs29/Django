# URL

## Things that I didn't know before but now I know

```
Technically 'urls.py' in the project folder is all we need for url mapping
, but we create another `urls.py` in the app folder to make urls.py in the project folder clean.

The reason why there isn't any urls.py in the app folder is that some app doesnt even require url.

# Django ORM (Querysets)

# How to create a post(object) using python interpreter

My app folder is called `blog` that has `models.py`

<em>blog/models.py</em>

```py
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)

    def publish(self):
        self.published_date = timezone.now()
        self.save()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
        
```

On my local terminal, 

```
$ python manage.py shell
```

I need to import Post class from blog.models

```
>>> from blog.models import Post
```

# Read post

To see all the posts(objects) I have created,

```
>>> Post.objects.all()
<QuerySet []>
```

It shows that no post has been created yet.


# Create a post

Now we will create a post.

```
>>> Post.objects.create(author = me, title = "Sample title", text = "Test")

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'me' is not defined
```

It tells me that 'me' is not defined yet

So I need to define 'me'.

```
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Let's check user
>>> User.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<User: kjs3980>]>
```

Now I can try the command that I wasn't able to execute

```
>>> Post.objects.create(author = me, title = "Sample title", text = "Test")

<Post: Sample title>
```

Notice that it shows `<Post: Sample title>`?

# Filter

```
>>> User.objects.filter(author = me)

<QuerySet [<Post: Sample title>]>
```

Another example

```
>>> Post.objects.filter(title__contains = "Sample")

<QuerySet [<Post: Sample title>]>
```

Another example

```
>>> Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now())
```

`filter(published_date__lte = 10)` means filter that is less or equal than 10

So `Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now())` means any post that was published before the time right now.(in the past)

# Order_by

We can also order objects by `create_date` field

```
>>> Post.objects.order_by('created_date')
```

or reverse the ordering by

```
>>> Post.objects.order_by('-created_date')
```

# Complex queries by method-chaining

```
>>> Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte = timezone.now()).order_by('published_date')
```

### To exit

```
>>> exit()
```



We can see all of these in our `domain/admin`, I am wondering if this is useful when we can access and filter it on `domain/admin` by using `ctrl + f`.
