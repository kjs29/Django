# URL

## Things that I didn't know before but now I know

```
Technically 'urls.py' in the project folder is all we need for url mapping
, but we create another `urls.py` in the app folder to make urls.py in the project folder clean.

The reason why there isn't any urls.py in the app folder is that some app doesnt even require url.
