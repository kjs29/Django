# To practice models.py

We can practice creating different models in `models.py` and register in `admin.py`

And in admin panel, we can see how these work together.

## Example


<em>models.py</em>

```py
from django.db import models

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    library = models.ForeignKey(Library)
    
```

<em>admin.py</em>

```py
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Books(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    library = models.ForeignKey(Library,on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

# Timezone

If we want to change our timezones, 

we go to `settings.py` and go to `TIME_ZONE` and change it to our time. I am in Calgary and if I search for `TZ database name` for Calgary I can find `Canada/Mountain`.

So in `settings.py`

```py
TIME_ZONE = 'Canada/Mountain'
```

But in the interactive shell API, it won't be refelcted but on the database admin panel, it will show the timezone correctly.

```
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> print(timezone.now())
```

This will NOT show the appropriate local time even after changing `TIME_ZONE` in `settings.py`

But in `models.py` if we set the 

`created_date = DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)`

Then we can find the appropriate time showing in the admin panel.

# Query 

Let's say we have `Celebrity` and `Fan` model.

Celebrity can have many fans but fan can have only one celebrity.

Then Fan to Celebrity is one to many relationship.

```py
from django.db import models

class Celebrity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Fan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    celebrity = models.ForeignKey(Celebrity, on_delete = models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

```

In our API interactive shell, we can create celebrity object.

```
python manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from appname.models import Celebrity, Fan
>>> first = Celebrity(name = "Brad Pitt")
>>> first.save()
```

Let's see the fans that like `Brad Pitt`.

```
>>> first.fan_set.all()
<QuerySet []>
```

Now we can also create a couple of fans who like `Brad Pitt`.

```
>>> first.fan_set.create(name="christina")
>>> a = first.fan_set.create(name="So young")
```

```
>>> a.celebrity
<Celebrity: Brad Pitt>
```

This shows we can access to any subfields in any models as long as they are relational.

Relationship between Celebrity and Fan 

`Celebrity : Fan = One : Many` 

### When we want to access all Fan that like `Brad Pitt` 

1. Directly from Fans

```
>>> Fan.objects.filter(celebrity="Brad Pitt")
```

```
>>> Fan.objects.filter(celebrity__name="Brad Pitt")
```

2. Using related object set

```
>>> brad_pitt = Celebrity.objects.get(name="Brad Pitt")
>>> brad_pitt.fan_set.all()
```

### What celebrity does `So young` like?

Since one fan can like just one celebrity we can easily find out by

```
>>> Fan.objects.get(name="So young").celebrity
<Celebrity: Brad Pitt>
```

### Use double underscore to separate relationships (Field Lookups)

[official django source -> search for 'field lookup'](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups)

We have `models.py`

```py
from django.db import models

class Celebrity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Fan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    celebrity = models.ForeignKey(Celebrity, on_delete = models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

```py
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone
import datetime

class Celebrity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Fan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    celebrity = models.ForeignKey(Celebrity, on_delete = models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

What if I want to print out all the fans that have celebrity that have 't's in their names? In other words, Find all Fans for any Celebrity who have 't's in their names. (hint : use two underscores)

```
>>> Fan.objects.filter(celebrity__name__contains='t')
```

We can get as deep as possible like this.

```py
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone
import datetime

class Celebrity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Fan(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    celebrity = models.ForeignKey(Celebrity, on_delete = models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Dog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    owner = models.ForeignKey(Fan, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Let's see some instance of Celebrity, Fan, Dog

```
>>> Celebrity.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Celebrity: Brad Pitt>, <Celebrity: Sam>]>

>>> Fan.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Fan: christina>, <Fan: So young>, <Fan: Jin>]>

>>> Dog.objects.all()
<QuerySet []>
```

Let's create some instance of Dog, whose owner's name is Jin.

```
>>> Dog(name="Nabi", owner=Fan.objects.filter(name="Jin")).save()

>>> Dog.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Dog: Nabi>]>
```

### Find all the dogs whose owner that likes celebrity that has 'Sam' in it.

```
>>> Dogs.objects.filter(owner__celebrity__name__contains="Sam")
<QuerySet [<Dog: Nabi>]>
```
