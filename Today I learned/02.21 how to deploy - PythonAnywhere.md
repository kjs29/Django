# How to deploy django app using Pythonanywhere.com as a web server



1. Make Pythonanywhere Account

2. Git clone repository on Pythonanywhere's console

```
$ git clone (github repo address)
```

3. Create a virtual environment

```
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 venv
```

We have to remember what python we should be using for our django project.

`venv` is the name of the virtual environment

4. Download requirements.txt

```
(venv) $ pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Home directory is already set to `/home/my-username/`. So if the `requirements.txt` file is located in `/home/my-username/django-project-outer-folder/`,

We have to write 

```
(venv) $ pip install -r django-project-outer-folder/requirements.txt
```

5. Create a web app on Pythonanywhere.com

Click manual configuration - this is for existing django project

6. Set virtualenv file path on Pythonanywhere.com

7. Configure WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) file on Pythonanywhere.com

```
In a Django project, the WSGI file is typically named wsgi.py and is located in the project's root directory. 

The purpose of this file is to create a WSGI application object that the web server can use to communicate with the Django application. 

The wsgi.py file imports the Django settings module and calls the get_wsgi_application() function to create the WSGI application object.

When a web request is made to the Django application, 

the web server will use the WSGI application object created in the wsgi.py file to handle the request and return a response. 

This allows the Django application to run as a standalone web application without requiring any additional software or middleware.
```

Make sure that `path` is set to where `manage.py` file is located.

Also, `os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'` is set by default, but since my project folder is also named `mysite`, I didn't need to change it.

8. Configure settings.py file on Pythonanywhere.com

`DEBUG` should be `False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should be our domain on Pythonanywhere.com

And I created a `secret_key.txt` in the appropriate directory on Pythonanywhere.com because I shouldn't reveal my secret key on anywhere.

<em>secret_key.txt(example)</em>

```txt
'abcdefghijklmnop1234567890'
```

9. Database migrations

We need to create new data tables we can do so by

Going to console on Pythonanywhere.com and type,

```
(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations <app name>
```

```
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
```

10. For the static files (user upload files, images, javascript files, etc), go to

In here we can see that there are URL and Directory, but we can use just one.

Since my `settings.MEDIA_ROOT` is at `BASE_DIR / 'media'`, here `BASE_DIR` refers to project root directory(where `manage.py` file is located) by default, Pythonanywhere.com's homepath is `/home/kjs3980/` so I set Directory as `/home/kjs3980/how-to-make-a-social-media-website/media`.

11. For debugging, check Error log on Pythonanywhere.com

Here we can see the logs like the picture below

### Relfect the changes on Pythonanywhere.com -> reload the web app

# In summary, 

The key points of deploying on Pythonanywhere.com are like

- how to create a new project, or clone a new project and download required packages properly inside virtualenv

- how to configure wsgi file on Pythonanywhere.com

- how to configure settings.py (secret_key handling, debug = False, etc)

- how to migrate database

- how to configure static files on Pythonanywhere.com

- how to debug (check error logs on Pythonanywhere.com)
