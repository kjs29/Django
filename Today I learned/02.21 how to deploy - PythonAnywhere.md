# How to deploy django app using Pythonanywhere.com as a web server



1. Make Pythonanywhere Account

2. Git clone repository on Pythonanywhere's console

```
$ git clone (github repo address)
```

3. Create a virtual environment

```
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 venv
```

We have to remember what python we should be using for our django project.

`venv` is the name of the virtual environment

4. Download requirements.txt

```
(venv) $ pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Home directory is already set to `/home/my-username/`. So if the `requirements.txt` file is located in `/home/my-username/django-project-outer-folder/`,

We have to write 

```
(venv) $ pip install -r django-project-outer-folder/requirements.txt
```

5. Create a web app on Pythonanywhere.com

Click manual configuration - this is for existing django project

6. Set virtualenv file path on Pythonanywhere.com

7. Configure WSGI file on Pythonanywhere.com

Make sure that `path` is set to where `manage.py` file is located.

Also, `os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'` is set by default, but since my project folder is also named `mysite`, I didn't need to change it.

8. Configure settings.py file on Pythonanywhere.com

`DEBUG` should be `False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should be our domain on Pythonanywhere.com

And I created a `secret_key.txt` in the appropriate directory on Pythonanywhere.com because I shouldn't reveal my secret key on anywhere.

<em>secret_key.txt(example)</em>

```txt
'abcdefghijklmnop1234567890'
```

9. Database migrations

We need to create new data tables we can do so by

Going to console on Pythonanywhere.com and type,

```
(venv) $ python manage.py makemigrations
```

```
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
```

10. For the static files (user upload files, images, javascript files, etc), go to 

11. For debugging, check Error log on Pythonanywhere.com

### Relfect the changes on Pythonanywhere.com -> reload the web app
