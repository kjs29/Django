# How to use openai API

I watched a video where people say that they were using openai API to implement their crazy powered AI machine to their own website.

I got interested in it and I decided to try it too.

This was the first time I was using any API from anywhere.

I am glad that it worked and I am more curious about how this works.

`views.py`

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")

model = 'text-davinci-003'

def home(request):
    openai.api_key = API_KEY
    user_input = request.POST.get('user_input')

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        prompt = user_input,
        model = model,
        max_tokens = 1000,
        temperature = 0.2,

    )   
    print(user_input)
    print(response)
    
    answer = response['choices'][0]['text']
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'user_input':user_input, 'answer':answer})
```

Actually where I struggled the most was the fact that python file couldnt import openai, it showed ReportsMissing.

I fixed the problem when I downloaded the openai module with zsh terminal.

The reason turned out to be that I had two different terminals and they had different PATH variables.

My VScode's default terminal was zsh but for some reason it said bash still, but bash has different icon than zsh.

I should set correct path in each paths, and what I did was just changing the default terminal to zsh.

### Possible reasons why ReportMissingImports happened

```
1. PATH variable differences: Zsh and Bash use different PATH variables, which may result in pip being in a different location for each shell. Ensure that the correct PATH is set in each shell.

2. Different shell configurations: The configuration files for Zsh and Bash are different, and it's possible that one of them is interfering with pip.

3. Virtual Environment differences: If you are using virtual environments, the virtual environment might not be activated in one of the shells, causing pip to not work.

4. Different versions of Python: If you have multiple versions of Python installed, the version that pip is associated with might differ between the two shells.
```

and in `home.html`

This what my website says using openai API.

# What I learned about using API is using API is not that difficult.

It just requires some reading and understanding what they instruct us to do.
