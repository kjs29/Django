We have database

Lawyer

|name|nickname|id|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|John|Jonny|1|
|Craig|Cry|2|
|Gill|Topg|3|

Client

|name|lawyer|id|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Aba|John|1|
|Jay|John|2|
|Agron|Craig|3|
|Raymond|Gill|4|
|Ying|Gill|5|
|Herold|Gill|6|

<a name = "create"></a>

# ${To\ {\color{blueviolet}Create}}\ data $


### 1. Go to python shell
```
py manage.py shell
```
### 2. Import Object from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

Ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3. Create data (In this case, let's create a new client)
```
>>> next_instance = Client(name="Jessica", lawyer="Gill")
```
if we type 

```
>>> next_instance
```

we get
```
<Client: Jessica>
```

### 4. Save
```
next_instance.save()
```

<a name = "read"></a>

# ${To\ {\color{yellow}Read}}\ data$

Now we can check our database for Client

### 1. Go to python shell

```py
py manage.py shell
```

### 2. Import Object from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

Ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3.1 Read all instances

```
>>> all = Client.objects.all()
```
Now we can see every instance by typing 
```
>>> all
```
We can see every instance like this.
```
<QuerySet [<Client: Aba (1)>, <Client: Jay (2)>, <Client: Agron (3)>, <Client: Raymond (4)>, <Client: Ying (5)>, <Client: Herold (6)>, <Client: Jessica (7)>]>
```
We can see that `<Client: Jessica (7)>` is also in the Client query set, because we just created the [new instance](#create).

### 3.2 Read the first instance

There are two ways to read the first instance in the database.

The first way
```
>>> first_client = Client.objects.first()
```
```
>>> first_client
```
The second way
```py
>>> first_client = Client.objects.all()[0]
```
```
>>> first_client
```
Both the first way and the second way will show like this

```
<Client: Aba (1)>
```

<a name = "update"></a>
# ${To\ {\color{orange}Update}}\ data$

### 1. Go to python shell

```
py manage.py shell
```

### 2. Import class from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3. Change(update) the instance 

In this case, let's change the name of the first instance in Client model

```
>>> first_instance = Client.objects.first()
```

```
>>> first_instance.name 
'Aba'
```

Let's change from `Aba` to `Gucci`
```
>>> first_instance.name = "Gucci"
```

### 4. Save

```
first_instance.save()
```

Now we can check to see if we changed the name of the first instance.

```
>>> first_instance = Owner.objects.first()
```
```
>>> first_instance.name
'Gucci'
```

### If we wanted to change the name of the third instance
```
>>> third_instance = Client.objects.all()[2]
'Agron'

>>> third_instance.name = "Betty"

>>> third_instance.save()

>>> third_instance
<Client: Betty (3)>
```


<a name = "delete"></a>
# ${To\ {\color{grey}Delete}}\ data$

### 1. Go to python shell

```
py manage.py shell
```


### 2. Import class from models

```
>>> from appname.models import classname
```

ex)

```
>>> from app1.models import Client
```

### 3. Delete the instance

Let's say we want to delete the last instance in Client

```
>>> last_instance = Client.objects.all()[-1]
```

Now we can delete

```
>>> last_instance.delete()
```

Also, we can check to see if we successfully deleted the last instance in Client

```
>>> all = Clients.objects.all()
```
We can see that the last client that we created [Jessica](#create) is gone now.
```
<QuerySet [<Client: Gucci (1)>, <Client: Jay (2)>, <Client: Agron (3)>, <Client: Raymond (4)>, <Client: Ying (5)>, <Client: Herold (6)>]>
```

# More on query methods

They have more query methods like `.get()`, `get_or_create()`, `.exclude()`, `.order_by()` etc.

`.get()` method is for [Read](#read)

Find client whose name is "Ying"
```
>>> Client.objects.get(name="Ying")
```

`.get_or_create()` method is for both [Read](#read) and [Create](#create).
Find  client whose name is "Don", if it doesn't exist create a new instance
```
>>> new = Client.objects.get_or_create(name="Don")

>>> new
(<Client: Don (7)>, True)
```
If it is true, it means it just created a new instance, if it is false, it was not created.
