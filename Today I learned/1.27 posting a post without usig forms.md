# Let's try to implement 'Posting' on a website

Let's implement posting a post with username, post title, post body. User doens't have to be authenticated, or authorized to write a post. Do NOT use django built in forms(`from django import forms`). 

For now, we will make User model that doesn't need any authentication/authorization, and one user can post many posts and each post is written by just one user. In other words, `User : Post = One : Many` relationship.

That means it's better to create User model first, and Post because Post model will require User model in the author field.

In models.py,

```py
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.username


class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    body = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Run these two commands.

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrte`

In urls.py in app folder, create a path(URLconf) that has url, and the corresponding function in views and a namespace.

```py
from django.urls import path

# ...
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('create/', views.create, name='create'),
]
```

In views.py, set a function that has the same name as the funciton that we just passed in in the urlpatterns.

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
#...

def create(request):
    return render(request, 'create.html', {}) 
```

Here, we can see that it has 'create.html' in the render function which means it brings the template called 'create.html' when they execute this function.

Now we need to create 'create.html' in the `templates` folder.

I won't mention where to put templates folder here since this is about implementing forms.

In `create.html` file we will write a `<form></form>`.

```html
<!-- ... -->
<form action="" method="post">{% csrf_token %}
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" value=""><br>
    <label for="posttitle">Post title</label>
    <input type="text" id="posttitle" name="posttitle" value=""><br>
    <label for="postbody"></label>
    <textarea type="text" id="postbody" name="postbody"></textarea><br>
    <input type="submit" value="post">
</form>
<!-- ... -->
```

Now going back to views.py

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.urls import reverse
from .models import User, Post
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def create(request):
    if request.mehod == "POST":
        new_username = request.POST.get('username')
        new_user = User(username=new_username)

        new_posttitle = request.POST.get('posttitle')
        new_postbody = request.POST.get('postbody')
        new_post = Post(title=new_posttitle, body=new_postbody, author=new_user)
        new_post.save()

        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('home'))

    else:
        render(request, 'create.html', {})
```

And since we create a 'home' page, we need to create a function for 'home' and create a corresponding template.

```py
def home(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    render(request, 'home.html', {'post':posts})
```

```html
<!-- ... -->
{% for post in posts %}
    <p>{{post.title}}</p>
    <p>{{post.body}}</p>
    <p>{{post.author}}</p>
{% endfor %}
<a href="{% url 'create' %}">create</a>
```
