# 1.16 Today I learned...

# To print the current directory

```
$ python manage.py shell
```

```
>>> import os
>>> print(os.getcwd())
```

# To find the directory of `base_dir`

```
$ python manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from django.conf import settings
>>> print(settings.BASE_DIR)
```

We can also configure the BASE_DIR in settings.py too


# How to create dynamic urls

For the convenience, I will write in one urls.py in the project foler.

But this should be organized in different files later.

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.http import HttpResponse


def homepage(request, randomstr):
    return HttpResponse(f"hello {str(randomstr)}")

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('<str:randomstr>/', homepage)
]
```

`randomstr` in homepage function and the path should be identical to work.


It is better to organize the codes, so 

`urls.py` in the project folder

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('appfolder.urls'))
]
```

views.py in app folder

```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def homepage(request,pk):
    return HttpResponse(f"hello {str(pk)}")
```

urls.py in app folder

```py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('<str:pk>/', views.homepage),
]  
```
