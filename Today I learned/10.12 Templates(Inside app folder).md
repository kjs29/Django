# 10/12 Today I learned...


# Method 1 (put the templates folder inside the app)
## 1. `templates` folder is created in the app folder `myfirstapp`
## 2. Inside the `templates` folder, create another folder called `myfirstapp`, that is the same name as app
## 3. Create a html file in `myfirstapp\templates\myfirstapp`, ex) home.html

<em>myfirstapp \ templates \ myfirstapp \ home.html</em>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Django Fortune Teller</title>
    <style>
      body {
        text-align: center;
        background-color: black;
        color: green;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Here is your fortune:</h1>

    <h4>{{ fortune }}</h4>
  </body>
</html>
```
## 4. In the myfirstapp\views.py

In the `render()` function, there are three arguments that go in

request, template_name, mapping

In the template_name, that is where the directory of the `home.html` can go in.


### directory of the template = `myfirstapp\templates\myfirstapp\home.html`

### as the second argument in render function = `myfirstapp/home.html`

<em>myfirstapp \ views.py</em>
```py
from django.shortcuts import render
from random

fortuneList = [
    "You will achieve what you want to achieve today.",
    "You have the power to change your future.",
    "You will have great websites that become very successful."
]

def index(request):
    pickone = random.choice(fortuneList)
    context = {"fortune" : pickone}
    
    # render function arguments as return value
    # this is where template directory can go in
    return render(request, "myfirstapp/home.html", context)
```
## 5. In the myownproject\urls.py
<em>myownproject \ urls.py</em>
```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    
    # this line means that if the website is just the domain name (because there is only ""),
    # it will link the 'urls.py' in the 'myfirstapp' folder
    # all the related url paths can go in myfirstapp\urls.py
    path('',include('myfirstapp.urls')
]
```

## 6. Now, in the myfirstapp\urls.py,

<em>myfirstapp \ urls.py</em>

```py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    
    # There is "" , which means that this will link to index function in views.py and show it
    # If there is "hello/", which means that people can type "mydomain.com/hello" and see what index function shows in the views.py
    path("", views.index)
]
```
## 7. Now check the website to see if template works!

On a command prompt..
```
py manage.py runserver
```
