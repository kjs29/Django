# How to set up for django project on MacOS

I am following this coursera course [Django web framework by Meta](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/welcome).


1. Create a project directory

```
$ mkdir buildDjango
```

- Go to the directory

```
$ cd buildDjango
```


2. Create a virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv tutorial-env
```

This creates a virtual environment called `tutorial-env`

After this command, you notice that `bin`, `include`, `lib` were created under `tutorial-env` folder.

- we need to activate this virtual environment `tutorial-env`

```
$ source tutorial-env/bin/activate
```

After this command we can see that

```
(tutorial-env) My-Mac:
```

- we need to install Django here

```
$ python3 install django
```

- to check if we successfully installed django in a virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m django version
```

```
4.1.5
```

3. Create a Django project

```
$ django-admin startproject chefsTable
```

If you typed like this code above, then you will create a folder `chefsTable` and inside of it, there will be another folder `chefsTable`.

But if you type like this below, you will create a folder just once and avoid having sub-directories with the same name.

```
$ django-admin startproject chefsTable
```

4. Run development server

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
