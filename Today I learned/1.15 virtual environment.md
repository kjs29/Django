# Virtual environment

## To create a virtual environment named `hello`

we can use `venv`, `virtualenv`, `conda` etc.

I personally used `venv`.

```
$ python3 -m venv hello
```

Then it creates one virtual environment named `hello`.

If we create a directory where our project goes, we can create a virtual environment on the root directory.

So If we create `pineapple` folder in desktop, and we want to put our project files in the `pineapple` folder,

then we can create virtual environment `hello` in `desktop/pineapple`.

```
pineapple/
│
├── hello/
│
└── project-files
```

## To activate the virtual environment


We just created a virtual environment `hello`.

```
$ source hello/bin/activate
```

Then we will see 

```
$ (hello) Js-MacBook-Pro:hello jinsung$
```

## To deactivate the virtual environment

We can deactivate the virtual environment

```
$ deactivate
```
